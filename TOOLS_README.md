# Reconnaissance

Information collection of the target before penetration testing



## ksubdomain

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/ksubdomain](https://github.com/knownsec/ksubdomain)

#### Project Overview：

ksubdomain is the fastest subdomain enumeration tool, and it runs on Windows/Linux/Mac.



## Zoomeye Tools

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Zoomeye-Tools](https://github.com/knownsec/Zoomeye-Tools)

#### Project Overview：

Zoomeye Tools includes Zoomeye minitools and Zoomeye preview.

Minitools is currently integrated for use in zoomeye.org, copy all targets in multiple formats, and enter the next scan in a convenient and quick way.

Preview implements a simple Zoomeye interface. When a user login and clicks on preview, he can quickly and easily see various information of the current station ip and open port information.



## [Zoomeye-python](https://github.com/knownsec/ZoomEye-python)

#### Project link：

https://github.com/knownsec/ZoomEye-python

#### Project Overview：

`ZoomEye-python` is a Python library developed based on the `ZoomEye API`. It provides the `ZoomEye command line` mode and can also be integrated into other tools as an `SDK`. The library allows technicians to **search**, **filter**, and **export** `ZoomEye` data more conveniently.



# Vulnerability Assessment

Vulnerability scanning and detection of targets



## Pocsuite3

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/pocsuite3](https://github.com/knownsec/pocsuite3)

#### Project Overview：

pocsuite3 is an open-sourced remote vulnerability testing and proof-of-concept development framework developed by the [**Knownsec 404 Team**](http://www.knownsec.com/). It comes with a powerful proof-of-concept engine, many powerful features for the ultimate penetration testers and security researchers.



## [LSpider](https://github.com/knownsec/LSpider)

#### Project link：

https://github.com/knownsec/LSpider

#### Project Overview：

A front-end crawler for passive scanners~ It is composed of five parts: Chrome Headless, LSpider master control, Mysql database, RabbitMQ, and passive scanner. 

(1) Based on Chrome Headless, the core principle is to simulate clicks and trigger events, and to export traffic to the passive scanner by setting a proxy. 

(2) Divergent crawling through the built-in task + subdomain api, the purpose may trigger the traffic of the corresponding target domain. 

(3) Task management is carried out through RabbitMQ, supporting a large number of threads at the same time. 

(4) Fill in the form intelligently, submit the form, etc. 

(5) Use some methods to intelligently judge the login box and feed it back to the user. The user can complete the login by adding a cookie. 

(6) Customized the corresponding Webhook interface for sending Webhook statistics to WeChat. 

(7) Built-in Hackerone and bugcrowd crawlers, you can get all the range of a target with one click when you provide an account.



# Penetration Test

Penetration test on target



## shellcodeloader

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/shellcodeloader](https://github.com/knownsec/shellcodeloader)

#### Project Overview：

Because shellcode can be changed and restored at will, it is difficult to check and kill. Therefore, it is one of the most popular ways to bypass AV by making shellcode Trojan. However, for the conventional production method of shellcode payload of cobalt strike, the shellcode text needs to be encrypted, and put into the source code to find a way to bypass AV, then compile. 

The process is too cumbersome. Many of the steps are time-consuming and labor-consuming. After changing shellcode, many processes need to be repeated. 

This tool aims to solve most of the repetitive work in shellcodeloader generation process, reduce the working time of bypass AV, and put more energy on penetration or discovery of new ways to bypass AV.



# Information analysis

Analysis and processing of information in the penetration process, including code audits, etc.



## KunLun-M

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/LoRexxar/Kunlun-M](https://github.com/LoRexxar/Kunlun-M)

#### Project Overview：

Kunlun-Mirror is developed from Cobra-W2.0. After long-term maintenance and improvement, Kunlun-Mirror will focus on the development of tools on the use of security researchers, and will continuously improve the user experience around the use of tools.

At present, the tool mainly supports semantic analysis of php and javascript, as well as basic scanning of chrome ext and solidity.

KunLun-M may be the only open source and long-term maintained automated code audit tool on the market. It is hoped that open source tools can promote the development of white box auditing:>.



## KunLun-M - phpunserializechain

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/LoRexxar/Kunlun-M/tree/master/core/plugins/phpunserializechain](https://github.com/LoRexxar/Kunlun-M/tree/master/core/plugins/phpunserializechain)

#### Project Overview：

Based on the concept of .QL, a set of CodeDB was explored, and a tool demo for finding the PHP deserialization chain was exploratoryly completed. It is still demo in nature, and there are still many problems to be solved.



## KunLun-M - EntranceFinder

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/LoRexxar/Kunlun-M/tree/master/core/plugins/entrancefinder](https://github.com/LoRexxar/Kunlun-M/tree/master/core/plugins/entrancefinder)

#### Project Overview：

An interesting small tool for quickly discovering possible entry pages (or missing by developers) when auditing a large amount of php code.



# Back-penetration, intranet tools

Including maintenance of permissions after penetration and intranet tools, etc.



## Portforward

#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Portforward](https://github.com/knownsec/Portforward)
